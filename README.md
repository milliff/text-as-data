## Contents

- `text_analysis.Rmd`: Code (and explanation) for the text analysis demos. We cover 1) sentiment analysis using sentiment dictionaries and `tidytext`, 2) topic modeling with `stm`, and 3) regularized logit classification with `glmnet`.
- `stm.RData`: Loads a fitted STM model to save us time (and keep results consistent) during the workshop.
- `text_analysis_slides.pdf`: The slides!

Notably missing: `train.csv`, the data we use in the demos. Register [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3t3ByeeZ5oUh7Mi2KkkiP22IJ5dK9fF1D7CCCbStHjAqUwQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to get that file via email.
